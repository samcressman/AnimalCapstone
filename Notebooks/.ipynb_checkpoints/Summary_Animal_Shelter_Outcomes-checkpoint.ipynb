    "- Nearly every column required cleaning: it is critical to examine each column. <br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "- I broke out the DateTime columns (Intake Time, Outcome Time) by day, day of week, day of month, and year. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- I created columns for Age at Intake, Age at Outcome, and Length of Time in Shelter (Days). Also, half of the name values were null: I created a new column \"has_name\" which held a 1 if the animal left the animal shelter with a name or 0 otherwise. <br> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- Regarding Outcome Type, I combined \"Died\", \"Disposal\", \"Missing\", and \"Relocate\" into an \"Other\" bucket since these outcomes occurred very infrequently. The outcomes that I consider to be positive are \"Adoption\", \"Return to Owner\", and \"Transfer\", and I consider \"Euthanizia\" and \"Other\" to be negative outcomes. Austin relies on [numerous \"Transfer\" partners](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/approved-partners) (usually animal specific) to reach its goal of being 90+% no kill. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- With over 2212 \"unique\" Breed combinations, I used a Count Vectorizer to find the most important breeds. Then I created dummy columns to reflect those breeds numerically. This process was very similar for Color (539 \"unique\" colors)."

    "<br>\n",
