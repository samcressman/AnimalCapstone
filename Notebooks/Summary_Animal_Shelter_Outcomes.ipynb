Many animals are given up as unwanted by their owners, while others are picked up after getting lost or taken out of cruelty situations. Many of these animals find forever families to take them home, but just as many are not so lucky. 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year. <br>\n",

    "- Nearly every column required cleaning: it is critical to examine each column. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- I merged animal intake data with animal outcome data on each animal's unique Animal ID to ensure that each animal had one intake and one outcome. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- I broke out the DateTime columns (Intake Time, Outcome Time) by day, day of week, day of month, and year. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- I created columns for Age at Intake, Age at Outcome, and Length of Time in Shelter (Days). Also, half of the name values were null: I created a new column \"has_name\" which held a 1 if the animal left the animal shelter with a name or 0 otherwise. <br> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- Regarding Outcome Type, I combined \"Died\", \"Disposal\", \"Missing\", and \"Relocate\" into an \"Other\" bucket since these outcomes occurred very infrequently. The outcomes that I consider to be positive are \"Adoption\", \"Return to Owner\", and \"Transfer\", and I consider \"Euthanizia\" and \"Other\" to be negative outcomes. Austin relies on [numerous \"Transfer\" partners](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/approved-partners) (usually animal specific) to reach its goal of being 90+% no kill. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- With over 2212 \"unique\" Breed combinations, I used a Count Vectorizer to find the most important breeds. Then I created dummy columns to reflect those breeds numerically. This process was very similar for Color (539 \"unique\" colors)."

    "- Austin has gold standard animal shelter and partner systems due to lofty no-kill goals: it would be great to compare to a city with lower positive outcomes or less ambitious goals (open data for animal shelters is limited). <br>\n",

    "- I would also be curious to examine shelter intakes and outcomes from a colder climate than Austin, Texas. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- I would be curious to see the impact of animal size on Outcome Type: this is something that could further be explored. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- I noticed that the Austin Animal Center has a strong social media presence [(example)](https://www.instagram.com/austinanimalcenter/): it would be fascinating to understand and quantify social media's impact on driving animal adoptions."
